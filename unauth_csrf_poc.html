/**
* The following PoC shows how CVE-2019-10655 can be turned into a "pray and spray" CSRF attack to target devices that are only accessible on a private network.
*
* Due to the server not enforcing that the vulnerable "phonecookie" session identifier is actually being sent in the cookie, this value can be sent via a 
* XHR request using a "simple request" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS?fbclid=IwAR3gBKDUD4oK64oxXhGoFCYo-uhOYTRMIaW5IFsnxMEw6A4KPFNfJ7btLQ8#Simple_requests) 
* and trigger the auth bypass by using one of these safe headers and not trigger a CORS pre-flight request.
